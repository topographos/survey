## About

**Survey** is a repository store computational notebooks. The idea is to use literate programming paradigm to learn a variety of archaeological, spatial and statistical methods that I could potentially apply in my PhD research that investigates the settlement dispersal under Late Territorial Empires in the South-West Asia.
